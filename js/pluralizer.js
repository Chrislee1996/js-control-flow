let thing = 'dog';
let count = 1;

//create coundition if the count > 1 return + s
//else return the result 
//Note! I wasn't sure if 0 is suppose to added with an s or not since it wasn't mentioned  but since saying "0 dog or 0 cat" is kind of improper grammer, I figured it would make sense!

if (count == 1) {
